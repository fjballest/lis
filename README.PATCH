			Patching the Kernel
			===================

The LiS distribution contains a patch file that is intended for use
in the 2.0.24 version of the kernel.  Other kernels of about that
vintage will probably work just fine.

The patches are located in the file patches.streams.  To apply
these patches do the following, assuming that you un-tarred LiS
into the directory /usr/src/LiS.

      cd /usr/src/linux
      patch -p1 </usr/src/LiS/patches.streams
      make clean
      make depend
      make zImage
      lilo          (probably)

The resulting kernel should have the STREAMS executive installed
in it.  You can boot the updated kernel at this point.


		    Completing the Installation
		    ===========================

When the new kernel comes up, try out STREAMS by doing the following:

    cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/streams/LiS/head/linux
    ./makenodes

This will make the /dev entries specified by the STREAMS "config"
that was compiled into the kernel.  Don't be concerned about the
contents of "config" just yet.  The default will do.

Then enter the following line:

    cat /dev/runq &

This opens the "runq" driver which will enter a sleep-wakeup loop
and run the STREAMS queues.

At this point the STREAMS system is ready to run.


			Testing STREAMS
			===============

You can test STREAMS by doing the following:

    cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/streams/LiS/head/linux
    make strtst timetst

Run strtst (no parameters) to put STREAMS through its regression
test.  The output from this program will be VOLUMINOUS.  A copy
of it will go into your "syslog" file as well.  You may very well
not want to run this program.

Run timetst (no parameters) to time the round-trip time of writing
a message down to a STREAMS driver and reading it back.  This program
produces a small amount of output.  Try it.


			Add a Line to rc.local
			======================

If STREAMS seems to work OK and you want to run it all the time the
put the following line into your rc.local file.  This will run the
queues automatically when the system comes up after each boot.

	cat /dev/runq &


			Utility Programs
			================

The utility programs have already been made and copied to /usr/local/bin.

If you have tried strtst or timetst, above, try the following:

    streams -s

This will print out a summary of STREAMS activity.



		    Files and Directories
		    =====================

The patch file will create the following directory structure under
the directory /usr/src/linux:

./drivers/streams		All STREAMS files
  ./LiS				LiS source code tree
  ./LiS/head			Source code for STREAMS executive
  ./LiS/head/linux		Make directory for Linux kernel
  ./LiS/head/user		Make directory for user mode testing
  ./LiS/util			Source code for utility programs
  ./LiS/util/linux		Make directory for utilities
  ./LiS/drivers/str		Source code for sample STREAMS drivers
				some of which must be linked into the
				kernel for STREAMS to work.
  ./LiS/drivers/str/user	Make directory for user-mode versions
				of these drivers.
  ./LiS/include/sys		STREAMS includes usually found in
				/usr/include/sys on SVR4 systems.
  ./LiS/include/sys/LiS		Internal includes for files in LiS/head.

The directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/streams/Lis/util/linux builds
some utility programs which you may want to copy out to /usr/local/bin.
To do so, cd to that directory and enter "make install".

The programs that get installed are as follows:

  strconf		Processes a "config" file which specifies which
			STREAMS drivers are to be linked into the kernel.

  streams		A utility program that displays status of the
			STREAMS system and allows the setting of
			debug masks and some parameters.

  polltst		A small program that is useful to test that
			the STREAMS "poll" system call can be used
			on both STREAMS and non-STREAMS file descriptors.
